==============================

Dog_breed_classification - Deep Learning / Transfer Learning Project including deployment on Streamlit

This project uses data from Kaggle's 'Dog Breed Identification' competition with over 120 breeds and 10k+ images in both training and test sets.

📈 The execution plan was a two-phase approach:

    **First Go:**
    1. Prepping images and labels into Tensors
    2. Experimenting with models like mobilenet_v2
    3. Training and scoring predictions on Kaggle

    **Second Go:**
    1. Augmenting data by flipping images
    2. Employing another model, resnet_v2_50
    3. Training, scoring, and validating predictions

🌐 Deployment:
1. Crafted an interactive app on Streamlit for breed predictions
2. Published the project on GitHub
3. Successfully deployed the app on Streamlit Cloud
> Streamlit App- https://lnkd.in/dAqtsXPy


🔑 Key Learnings:
- Deep dive into TensorFlow and Neural Networks
- Implementing Transfer Learning with diverse pre-trained models
- Harnessing GPU power for training and predictions
- Seamlessly deploying models using Streamlit
